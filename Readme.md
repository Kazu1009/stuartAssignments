Welcome to my Stuart API project for the assignment #2 coded with nodeJs + TypeScript. 

To run the project clone the repository and run these commands first to install dependencies and generate js code

```console
npm install
npm initdb 
npm run dev:start
```
To run tests use:

```console
npm test
```

:warning: **Note: Running the tests will clear all data from DB**

You can test the endpoints using the attached [Postman Collection](https://github.com/Kazu1009/stuartAssignments/blob/main/Stuart.postman_collection.json)

Please visit my [Wiki](https://github.com/Kazu1009/stuartAssignments/wiki) page!

:warning: **I use SmartGit as a git UI and it's kinda buggy as you can see commits with both my personal (Kazu1009) and Allianz (abdel.zouak) users**
