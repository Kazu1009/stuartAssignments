Welcome to my Stuart API project for the assignment #2 coded with nodeJs + TypeScript

To run the project clone the repository and run these commands first to install dependencies and generate js code

```console
npm install
npm initdb 
npm run dev:start
```
To run tests use:

```console
npm test
```

:warning: **Note: Running the tests will clear all data from DB**
